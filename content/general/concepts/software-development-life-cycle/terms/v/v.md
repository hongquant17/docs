The **V model** is a Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)  that is based on the [Waterfall model](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/software-development-life-cycle/waterfall) and emphasizes the Verification and Validation of the product. Each phase of this model is operated along with a level of testing.

The V model was first put into use in the late twentieth century and has been widely used ever since. It can be divided in five main phases:

1. Requirements analysis
2. System design
3. Architectural design
4. Module design
5. Coding

Except for **Coding**, the other four phases are linked to a distinct testing activity each. Going up from the bottom **(Module design)**, those testing activities are, respectively:

- Unit testing
- Integration Testing
- System testing
- Acceptance testing

## Advantages

- Testing within each stage ensures each requirement is properly checked and validated, and that the product is of high quality and fulfills the requirements.
- Errors and issues are detected at an early stages thanks to early testing activities.
- Easy management and project planning.

## Disadvantages

- Unsuitable for large and complex projects or that require constant changes.
- Uncertain and risky due to lack of risk analysis.
